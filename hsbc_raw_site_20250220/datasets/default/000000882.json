Risk of Securities Trading</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The prices of securities fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. The price of a security may move up or down, and may become valueless. It is as likely that losses will be incurred rather than profit made as a result of buying and selling securities.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>2. Risk of Trading Futures and Options</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or options is substantial. In some circumstances, you may sustain losses in excess of your initial margin funds. Placing contingent orders, such as \"stop-loss\" or \"stop-limit\" orders, will not necessarily avoid loss. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. You may be called upon at short notice to deposit additional margin funds. If the required funds are not provided within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated. You will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account. You should therefore study and understand futures contracts and options before you trade and carefully consider whether such trading is suitable in the light of your own financial position and investment objectives. If you trade options you should inform yourself of exercise and expiration procedures and your rights and obligations upon exercise or expiry.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>3. Risk of Trading Growth Enterprise Market Stocks</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) stocks involve a high investment risk. In particular, companies may list on GEM with neither a track record of profitability nor any obligation to forecast future profitability. GEM stocks may be very volatile and illiquid.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You should make the decision to invest only after due and careful consideration. The greater risk profile and other characteristics of GEM mean that it is a market more suited to professional and other sophisticated investors.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Current information on GEM stocks may only be found on the internet website operated by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. GEM Companies are usually not required to issue paid announcements in gazetted newspapers.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You should seek independent professional advice if you are uncertain of or have not understood any aspect of this risk disclosure statement or the nature and risks involved in trading of GEM stocks.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>4. Risks of Client Assets Received or held outside Hong Kong</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Client assets received or held by the licensed or registered person outside Hong Kong are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant overseas jurisdiction which may be different from the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.571) and the rules made thereunder.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Consequently, such client assets may not enjoy the same protection as that conferred on client assets received or held in Hong Kong.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>5. Risk of Providing an Authority to repledge your Securities Collateral etc</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">There is risk if you provide the licensed or registered person with an authority that allows it to apply your securities or securities collateral pursuant to a securities borrowing and lending agreement, repledge your securities collateral for financial accommodation or deposit your securities collateral as collateral for the discharge and satisfaction of its settlement obligations and liabilities.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">If your securities or securities collateral are received or held by the licensed or registered person in Hong Kong, the above arrangement is allowed only if you consent in writing. Moreover, unless you are a professional investor, your authority must specify the period for which it is current and be limited to not more than 12 months. If you are a professional investor, these restrictions do not apply.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Additionally, your authority may be deemed to be renewed (i.e. without your written consent) if the licensed or registered person issues you a reminder at least 14 days prior to the expiry of the authority, and you do not object to such deemed renewal before the expiry date of your then existing authority.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You are not required by any law to sign these authorities. But an authority may be required by licensed or registered persons, for example, to facilitate margin lending to you or to allow your securities or securities collateral to be lent to or deposited as collateral with third parties. The licensed or registered person should explain to you the purposes for which one of these authorities is to be used.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">If you sign one of these authorities and your securities or securities collateral are lent to or deposited with third parties, those third parties will have a lien or charge on your securities or securities collateral. Although the licensed or registered person is responsible to you for securities or securities collateral lent or deposited under your authority, a default by it could result in the loss of your securities or securities collateral.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">A cash account not involving securities borrowing and lending is available from most licensed or registered persons. If you do not require margin facilities or do not wish your securities or securities collateral to be lent or pledged, do not sign the above authorities and ask to open this type of cash account.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>6. Risk of providing an authority to hold mail or to direct mail to third parties</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">If you provide the licensed or registered person with an authority to hold mail or to direct mail to third parties, it is important for you to promptly collect in person all contract notes and statements of your account and review them in detail to ensure that any anomalies or mistakes can be detected in a timely fashion.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>7. Risk of Margin Trading</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The risk of loss in financing a transaction by deposit of collateral is significant. You may sustain losses in excess of your cash and any other assets deposited as collateral with the licensed or registered person. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute contingent orders, such as \"stop-loss\" or \"stop-limit\" orders. You may be called upon at short notice to make additional margin deposits or interest payments. If the required margin deposits or interest payments are not made within the prescribed time, your collateral may be liquidated without your consent. Moreover, you will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account and interest charged on your account. You should therefore carefully consider whether such a financing arrangement is suitable in light of your own financial position and investment objectives.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>8. Risk of Trading Nasdaq-Amex Securities at The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The securities under the Nasdaq-Amex Pilot Program (\"PP\") are aimed at sophisticated investors. You should consult the licensed or registered person and become familiarised with the PP before trading in the PP securities. You should be aware that the PP securities are not regulated as a primary or secondary listing on the Main Board or the Growth Enterprise Market of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>9. Additional Risk Disclosure for Futures and Options Trading</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects of trading in futures and options. In light of the risks, you should undertake such transactions only if you understand the nature of the contracts (and contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk. Trading in futures and options is not suitable for many members of the public. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">9.1 Futures<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">(i) Effect of \"Leverage\" or \"Gearing\"</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the futures contract so that transactions are \"leveraged\" or \"geared\". A relatively small market movement will have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the firm to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be liable for any resulting deficit.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">(ii) Risk-reducing orders or strategies<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The placing of certain orders (e.g. \"stop-loss\" orders, or \"stop-limit\" orders) which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as \"spread\" and \"straddle\" positions may be as risky as taking simple \"long\" or \"short\" positions.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">9.2 Options<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">(i) Variable degree of risk</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of options should familiarise themselves with the type of option (i.e. put or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account the premium and all transaction costs.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the options or allow the options to expire. The exercise of an option results either in a cash settlement or in the purchaser acquiring or delivering the underlying interest. If the option is on a futures contract, the purchaser will acquire a futures position with associated liabilities for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the purchased options expire worthless, you will suffer a total loss of your investment which will consist of the option premium plus transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing deep-out-of-the-money options, you should be aware that the chance of such options becoming profitable ordinarily is remote.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Selling (\"writing\" or \"granting\") an option generally entails considerably greater risk than purchasing options. Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss well in excess of that amount. The seller will be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavourably.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The seller will also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to either settle the option in cash or to acquire or deliver the underlying interest. If the option is on a futures contract, the seller will acquire a position in a futures contract with associated liabilities for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the option is \"covered\" by the seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying interest or a futures contract or another option, the risk may be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Certain exchanges in some jurisdictions permit deferred payment of the option premium, exposing the purchaser to liability for margin payments not exceeding the amount of the premium. The purchaser is still subject to the risk of losing the premium and transaction costs. When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible for any unpaid premium outstanding at that time.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>10. Additional Risks common to Futures and Options</strong><br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.1 Terms and conditions of contracts</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You should ask the firm with which you deal about the terms and conditions of the specific futures or options which you are trading and associated obligations (e.g. the circumstances under which you may become obliged to make or take delivery of the underlying interest of a futures contract and, in respect of options, expiration dates and restrictions on the time for exercise). Under certain circumstances the specifications of outstanding contracts (including the exercise price of an option) may be modified by the exchange or clearing house to reflect changes in the underlying interest.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.2 Suspension or restriction of trading and pricing relationships<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Market conditions (e.g. illiquidity) and/or the operation of the rules of certain markets (e.g. the suspension of trading in any contract or contract month because of price limits or \"circuit breakers\") may increase the risk of loss by making it difficult or impossible to effect transactions or liquidate/offset positions. If you have sold options, this may increase the risk of loss.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Further, normal pricing relationships between the underlying interest and the futures, and the underlying interest and the option may not exist. This can occur when, for example, the futures contract underlying the option is subject to price limits while the option is not. The absence of an underlying reference price may make it difficult to judge \"fair value\".<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.3 Deposited cash and property<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You should familiarise yourself with the protections given to money or other property you deposit for domestic and foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover your money or property may be governed by specific legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which had been specifically identifiable as your own will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution in the event of a shortfall.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.4 Commission and other charges<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commission, fees and other charges for which you will be liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.5 Transactions in other jurisdictions<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.6 Currency risks<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether they are traded in your own or another jurisdiction) will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the currency denomination of the contract to another currency.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.7 Trading facilities<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Electronic trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems for the order-routing, execution, matching, registration or clearing of trades. As with all facilities and systems, they are vulnerable to temporary disruption or failure. Your ability to recover certain losses may be subject to limits on liability imposed by the system provider, the market, the clearing house and/or participant firms. Such limits may vary: you should ask the firm with which you deal for details in this respect.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.8 Electronic trading<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Trading on an electronic trading system may differ from trading on other electronic trading systems. If you undertake transactions on an electronic trading system, you will be exposed to risks associated with the system including the failure of hardware and software. The result of any system failure may be that your order is either not executed according to your instructions or is not executed at all.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">10.9 Off-exchange transactions<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">In some jurisdictions, and only then in restricted circumstances, firms are permitted to effect off-exchange transactions. The firm with which you deal may be acting as your counterparty to the transaction. It may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value, to determine a fair price or to assess the exposure to risk. For these reasons, these transactions may involve increased risks. Off-exchange transactions may be less regulated or subject to a separate regulatory regime. Before you undertake such transactions, you should familiarise yourself with applicable rules and attendant risks.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong>11. Risk of Trading Warrants and Callable Bull/Bear Contracts</strong></p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Warrants and Callable Bull/Bear Contracts (CBBCs) are structured products which involve derivatives.</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You rely on the creditworthiness of the issuer of warrants and/or CCBCs. Subject to both the actual and perceived measures of the credit worthiness of its issuer and, there is no assurance of protection against a default by its issuer in respect of its payment obligations. Upon insolvency of the issuer, you may get nothing back and the potential maximum loss could be 100% of the investment amount and no return may be received.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">You are warned that the prices of warrants and CBBCs may fall in value as rapidly as it may rise and holders may sustain a total loss of their investment. CBBCs have a mandatory call feature and may therefore be subject to early termination, upon which (i) investors in category N CBBCs will lose all of their investments in the CBBCs; and (ii) the residual value of category R CBBCs may be zero.<br> </p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Before you purchase any warrants and/or CBBCs, you should ensure you understand the nature of warrants and/or CBBCs and carefully study the full details and risk factors set out in the relevant listing documents and, where necessary, seek professional advice before you invest in any of these products. You should also ensure that you fully understand the potential risks and rewards and independently determine that they are appropriate for you given your objectives, experience, financial and operational resources and other relevant circumstances. You should note that The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited acting through its appointed liquidity provider may be the only market participant in HSBC-issued warrants and CBBCs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n        \n    \n\n</div>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n        \n    \n

Please take note of the following additional risk disclosure</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>High yield bonds are typically rated below investment grade by a credit rating agency, or unrated. Whilst high yield bonds bear a higher yield opportunity than investment grade bonds, they present greater risks of issuer default, liquidity, volatility and non-payment of principal and interest.</li> \n <li>The risk of default on principal and / or interest, is greater for high yield bonds due to higher credit risk of the issuer and lower priority of claim by the bond holders in case of issuer default.</li> \n <li>High yield bonds can sometimes be less liquid than investment-grade bonds, depending on the issuer and the market conditions at any given time. Investors may be difficult to sell the high yield bond before maturity or at prices in line with their expectation compare to listed bond.</li> \n <li>High yield bonds tend to be more vulnerable to economic cycles and changes in the issuer’s financial conditions or business developments. In particular, during economic downturn, such bonds typically fall more in value than investment-grade bonds as the issuer default risk rises and investors become more risk adverse.</li> \n <li>Please be aware the concentration risk of investing in bonds issued by the same issuer or companies by the same group. A degrading of any of the group company's credit rating may expose the whole group to contagion risk. Please be also aware the risk of over concentrating investment in the high risk investment products.<br> </li> \n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n        \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            <div class=\"M-CONTMAST-RW-RBWM O-SMARTSPCGEN-DEV rich-text\" role=\"region\"><div id=\"content_main_richtext_93\" class=\" A-PAR16R-RW-ALL-WRAPPER\" data-date-format=\"D/M/YYYY\" data-time-format=\"HH:MM:SS A\" data-zone=\"Hongkong\">\n    <p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\"><strong><span class=\"A-TYP16B-RW-ALL\">General reminder</span></strong></p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>Past performance, if any, of the Notes are not indicative of future performance.

Subscription of units in the Fund may be suspended at any time if such quota is used up.</li> \n <li>Failure to meet eligibility requirements: If the Fund ceases to meet any of the eligibility requirements under the MRF, it may not be allowed to accept new subscriptions. In the worst scenario, the SFC may even withdraw its authorisation for the Fund to be publicly offered in Hong Kong for breach of eligibility requirements. There is no assurance that the Fund can satisfy these requirements on a continuous basis.</li> \n <li>Mainland China tax risk: Currently, certain tax concessions and exemptions are available to the Fund and/or its investors under the MRF regime. There is no assurance that such concessions and exemptions or Mainland tax laws and regulations will not change. Any change to the existing concessions and exemptions as well as the relevant laws and regulations may adversely affect the Fund and/or its investors and they may suffer substantial losses as a result.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Different market practices: Market practices in the Mainland China and Hong Kong may be different. In addition, operational arrangements of the Fund and other public funds offered in Hong Kong may be different in certain ways. For example, subscriptions or redemptions of units may only be processed on a day when both Mainland and Hong Kong markets are open, or it may have different cut-off times or dealing day arrangements versus other SFC-authorised funds. Investors should understand these differences and their implications.</li> \n</ul> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Concentration risk / Mainland China market risk</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>The Fund invests primarily in securities related to the Mainland China market and may be subject to additional concentration risk. Investing in the Mainland China market may give rise to different risks including political, policy, tax, economic, foreign exchange, legal, regulatory and liquidity risks.</li> \n</ul> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">RMB currency and conversion risks&nbsp;</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>RMB is currently not freely convertible and is subject to exchange controls and restrictions.</li> \n <li>Non-RMB based investors are exposed to foreign exchange risk and there is no guarantee that the value of RMB against the investors’ base currencies (for example HKD) will not depreciate. Any depreciation of RMB could adversely affect the value of investor’s investment in the Fund.</li> \n <li>Investors may not receive RMB upon redemption of investments and/or dividend payment or such payment may be delayed due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to RMB.</li> \n</ul> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Mainland China Equity risk&nbsp;</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>Market risk: The Fund’s investment in equity securities is subject to general market risks, whose value may fluctuate due to various factors, such as changes in investment sentiment, political and economic conditions and issuer-specific factors.</li> \n <li>Volatility risk: High market volatility and potential settlement difficulties in the Mainland China equity markets may also result in significant fluctuations in the prices of the securities traded on such markets and thereby may adversely affect the value of the Fund.</li> \n <li>Policy risk: Securities exchanges in Mainland China typically have the right to suspend or limit trading in any security traded on the relevant exchange. The government or the regulators may also implement policies that may affect the financial markets. All these may have a negative impact on the Fund.</li> \n <li>High stock valuation risk: The stocks listed on the Mainland China stock exchanges may have a higher price-earnings ratio; and such high valuation may not be sustainable and stock prices may fall drastically.</li> \n <li>Liquidity risk: Securities markets in Mainland China may be less liquid than other developed markets. The Fund may suffer substantial losses if it is not able to dispose of investments at a time it desires.</li> \n <li>Risk associated with small-capitalisation/mid-capitalisation companies: The stock of small-capitalisaction/mid-capitalisation companies may have lower liquidity and their prices are more volatile to adverse economic developments than those of larger capitalisation companies in general.</li> \n <li>Risk associated with ChiNext market:&nbsp;<br> <br> Differences in regulations: The rules and regulations regarding securities in the ChiNext market are less stringent in terms of profitability and share capital than those in the main board market.<br> <br> Emerging nature of ChiNext companies: Given the emerging nature of companies listed on the ChiNext market, there is a risk that the securities traded on ChiNext market may be susceptible to higher market volatility compared to securities traded on the main board market.<br> <br> Higher fluctuation on stock prices: Listed companies in the ChiNext market are usually in their preliminary stage of development having a smaller scale and shorter operating history and their stability and resistance to market risks may be lower. Hence, they are subject to higher fluctuation in stock prices as the performance of these companies changes. They are subject to higher risks and higher turnover ratios than companies listed on the main board.</li> \n <li>Delisting risk: The companies listed on the ChiNext market are generally less resistant to market risks and may experience more fluctuations in their performance. It may be more common and faster for listed companies in the ChiNext market than companies listed on main board and SME board to delist. This may have an adverse impact on the Fund if the companies that it invests in are delisted.</li> \n <li>Valuation risk: Conventional valuation methods may not be entirely applicable to companies listed in the ChiNext market. There are fewer circulating shares in the ChiNext market as such stock prices may be more susceptible to manipulation and may experience higher fluctuation upon market speculation. Stocks traded on the ChiNext market may be overvalued and such high valuation may not be sustainable.</li> \n</ul> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Mainland debt securities risks</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>Volatility and liquidity risks: The Mainland debt securities markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to more developed markets. The prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuations.</li> \n <li>Counterparty risk: The Fund is exposed to the credit/default risk of issuers of the debt securities that the Fund may invest in.</li> \n <li>Interest rate risk: Investment in the Fund is subject to interest rate risk. In general, the prices of debt securities rise when interest rates fall, whilst their prices fall when interest rates rise. The Fund is exposed to additional policy risk of potential adjustment by the government to the interbank deposit rate.</li> \n <li>Downgrading risk: The credit rating of a debt instrument or its issuer may be downgraded subsequent to investment by the Fund. In the event of such downgrading, the value of the Fund may be adversely affected. The Manager may or may not be able to dispose of the debt instruments that are being downgraded.</li> \n <li>Credit rating agency risk: The credit appraisal system in the Mainland and the rating methodologies employed in the Mainland may be different from those employed in other markets. Credit ratings given by Mainland rating agencies may therefore not be directly comparable with those given by other international rating agencies.</li> \n <li>Risk associated with urban investment bonds: The Fund may invest in urban investment bonds. Urban investment bonds are issued by local government financing vehicles (\"LGFVs\"), such bonds are typically not guaranteed by local governments or the central government of the Mainland. In the even that the LGFVs default on payment of principal or interest of the urban investment bonds, the Fund could suffer substantial loss and the net asset value of the Fund could be adversely affected.</li> \n <li>Risk associated with asset-backed securities: The Fund may invest in asset-backed securities (including asset-backed commercial papers). Asset-backed securities may be highly illiquid and prone to substantial price volatility. These instruments may be subject to greater credit, liquidity and interest rate risk compared to other debt securities. They are often exposed to extension and prepayment risks and risks that the payment obligations relating to the underlying assets are not met, which may adversely impact the returns of the securities.</li> \n <li>Risk associated with debt securities which are rated BB+ or below by a Mainland credit rating agency or unrated: The Fund may invest in debt securities rated BB+ or below by a Mainland credit rating agency or unrated. Such securities are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and interest than high-rated debt securities.</li> \n</ul> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">Risks associated with repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions:&nbsp;</p> \n<p class=\"A-PAR16R-RW-ALL\">The Manager may enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions for the account of the Fund on the Mainland stock exchanges or in the interbank market.</p> \n<ul class=\"A-LSTU-RW-ALL\"> \n <li>The collateral pledged under the reverse repurchase transactions in the interbank market may not be marked-to-market. In addition, the Fund may suffer substantial loss when engaging in reverse repurchase transactions as there may be delay and difficulties in recovering cash placed out or realizing the collateral, or proceeds from the sale of the collateral may be less than the cash placed with the counterparty due to inadequate valuation of the collateral and market movements upon default of the counterparty.</li> \n <li>For repurchase transactions, the Fund may suffer substantial loss as there may be delay and difficulties in recovering collateral pledged with the counterparty or the cash originally received may be less than the collateral pledged due to inadequate valuation of the collateral and market movement upon default of the counterparty.</li> \n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n        \n    \n\n</div>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n</div>\n\n        \n    \n\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n        \n    \n\n\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n        \n    \n\n</div>\n        </div>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n        <div class=\"row with-bg\">\n            <div class=\"sm-12\">\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            <div class=\"O-SMARTSPCGEN-DEV M-BACKTOTOP-RW-RBWM\" role=\"region\"><div id=\"content_rel_backtotop_1\">\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    <div id=\"content_rel_link_1\" class=\"link-container\">\n        <a class=\"A-LNKAU-RW-ALL\" href=\"#\" tabindex=\"0\">\n            \n            \n    <span class=\"link\">Back to Top</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"icon icon-anchor-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n    \n\n            \n        </a>\n    </div>\n\n\n</div></div>\n\n        \n    \n\n</div>\n        </div>\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n</main>\n\n\n<footer class=\"footer\">\n<div class=\"footerv2\">\n    <div class=\"down-tier-footer\">\n        <div class=\"grid\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"wrapper\">\n                    <div class=\"footer-info-links\">\n                        <ul class=\"navigation\">\n                            <li class=\"navigation-item\">\n                                <a href=\"/misc/privacy-security/\">\n                                    <span>Privacy and Security</span>\n                                    \n                                </a>\n                            </li>\n                        \n                            <li class=\"navigation-item\">\n                                <a href=\"/misc/terms-of-use/\">\n                                    <span>Terms of Use</span>\n                                    \n                                </a>\n                            </li>\n                        \n                            <li class=\"navigation-item\">\n                                <a href=\"/misc/hyperlink-policy/\">\n                                    <span>Hyperlink Policy</span>\n                                    \n                                </a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </div>\n                    \n    \n    <div class=\"footer-legal-regulatory\"><p>© Copyright.
